# Time-Series-Analysis - Additive Model Forecasting
A Python-based time series forecasting project focusing on additive models and seasonal trend prediction using data analytics and visualization techniques.


## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and modeling **time series data** using Python.  
It demonstrates how additive models can capture **trend**, **seasonality**, and **noise** components to make accurate predictions.

Time series data is critical for applications like:
- 📈 Financial forecasting
- 🌦️ Weather prediction
- ⚡ Energy consumption analysis
- 🛒 Sales and demand forecasting


##  Key Objectives
- Analyze real-world time-dependent data  
- Identify patterns, trends, and seasonal variations  
- Implement additive model decomposition  
- Visualize results and generate forecasts  


##  Technologies Used
| Tool / Library | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| **Python 3** | Core programming |
| **Pandas** | Data manipulation |
| **Matplotlib** | Data visualization |
| **Statsmodels** | Time series modeling |
| **NumPy** | Numerical computation |
