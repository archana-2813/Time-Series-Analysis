Methodology
1. **Data Preparation** – Organizing time-indexed data for analysis  
2. **Trend Analysis** – Observing long-term movement  
3. **Seasonality Detection** – Identifying cyclical patterns  
4. **Additive Model** – Combining trend + seasonality + residuals  
5. **Forecasting** – Predicting future data points  



Results & Insights
- Demonstrated seasonal and trend decomposition using additive models  
- Achieved stable and interpretable forecasts  
- Validated results through visualization and model testing  



Future Work
- Implement ARIMA and Prophet models for extended forecasting  
- Automate model selection and evaluation metrics  
- Integrate dashboard visualization with Tableau or Plotly
